The game is made for the Java CPSC 233 course. This game is much like a hotel simulator, where there are mutiple interactions
with multiple characters. Each character you interact with and the choices you make in this game will eventually influence
the ending you get.

## How to compile and run

1.) Download the repository and store it on any part of your computer. An example would be 

```
C:/Users/Desktop/tip2thetop
```

2.) Make sure you have Java8 installed as you will need it to run the application. The most recent versions of Java, such as JDK11
do not come with support for JavaFX.

Instructions on the installation of Java can be found [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml)

3.) Compile the game in the terminal of your choice.
```
cd tip2thetop
cd src
cd application
javac Game.java
```

If you get no compilation errors, proceed with running the CLASS file that was just made

```
java Game
```
