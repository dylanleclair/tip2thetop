The game is made for the Java CPSC 233 course. This game is much like a hotel simulator, where there are mutiple interactions
with multiple characters. Each character you interact with and the choices you make in this game will eventually influence
the ending you get.

## Technologies
Made with the JavaFX Library and JDK 1.8.

## Setup/Installation

1.) Install git for the desktop [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Choose the appropriate operating system.

2.) Open the command line, then clone the source repository from GitHub

```
git clone https://github.com/dylanleclair/tip2thetop.git
```

If you are on windows, the repository will be cloned to wherever your initial directory is located from when you started the installation.

Such as here<br/>

You can see that the terminal is in 
```
C:\Users\J
```
That is where the git clone will be located.

3.) Make sure you have Java8 installed as you will need it to run the application.<br/> Recent versions such as JDK 11 lack support
for JavaFX

Instructions on the installation of Java can be found [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml)

4.) Compile the game in the terminal of your choice. First load the directory the repository is located in

Then follow the steps below.
```
cd tip2thetop
cd src
cd application
javac Game.java
```

If you get no compilation errors, proceed with running the CLASS file that was just made.

```
java Game
```
