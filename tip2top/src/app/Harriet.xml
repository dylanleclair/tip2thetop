		<print>You: Okay, one premium room.</print>
		<print>You: What’s your name?</print>
		<print>???: Harriet.</print>
		<print>You: And how many days will you be staying?</print>
		<print>Harriet: 2 nights, ugh. Your attention span is on the same caliber of a goldfish.</print>

		<print>Harriet: And that room better have 3 ply toilet paper.</print>
		<print>You: We only carry 2 ply, sorry.</print>
		<print>Harriet: Bah! Nevermind, I can’t stay in this dirt hole.</print>
