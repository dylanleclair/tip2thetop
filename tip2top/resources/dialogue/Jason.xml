		<print>You: Why do you need mints to do math anyways?</print>
		<print>Jason: Well, you see with a minty fresh breath…</print>
		<print>Jason: I can always feel good about the math I’m doing.</print>
		<print>You: But, it’s math.</print>
		<print>You: I don’t see how you can feel very good about it.</print>
		<print>Jason: It’s because it’s math!</print>
		<print>Jason: Math always feels good.</print>
		<print>You: Well, alright.</print>

		<print>Jason: Now how am I supposed to do maths?</print>
		<print>Jason: Vectors don’t calculate themselves you know.</print>
		<print>You: Well, you could always do the math without the mints.</print>
		<print>Jason: Wow, have you ever done linear algebra?</print>
		<print>Jason: You might need some tutoring sessions.</print>

		<print>Jason: And I was wondering if you’d like to try it out.</print>
		<print>Jason: It’s quite easy to use.</print>
		<print>Jason: It’s a math program, to help you learn linear algebra.</print>
		<print>Jason: It’s called Lyrynx.</print>
		<print>Jason: You can learn how to solve matrices, find the area of a</print>
		<print>parallelepiped, calculate vectors in 17 dimensions...</print>
		<print>Jason: What do you say?</print>
		<print>Jason: It’s only $40 a month.</print>
